      "        *   `C13`: Decreased the log odds of fraud by 0.16.\n",
      "        *   `M4`: Decreased the log odds of fraud by 0.15.\n",
      "        *   `C14`: Decreased the log odds of fraud by 0.11.\n",

      "        *   `PCA_V_5`: Decreased the log odds of fraud by 0.07.\n",
      "        *   `124 other features`: In aggregate, significantly decreased the log odds of fraud by 0.7.\n",

      "    *   Some features pushed the prediction towards *higher* fraud probability (red features), but their impact was smaller:\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **Conclusion:**  While some features hinted at potential fraud (red), the combined effect of the features indicating a lower likelihood of fraud (blue) was much stronger, resulting in the model classifying the transaction as \"not fraud\". The aggregate effect of the 124 other features had a significant contribution to this prediction.\n"
